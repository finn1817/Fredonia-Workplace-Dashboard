## 🎯 How It Works

### For Admins (Creating Announcements):
1. Click "Add Announcement"
2. Drag & drop files or click the upload area
3. Watch upload progress in real-time
4. Images and files are stored in Firebase Storage
5. Save announcement - attachments are permanently linked

### For All Users (Viewing Announcements):
1. **Images**: Display automatically inline in announcements
2. **Other Files**: Show as clickable download links with file icons
3. **Full-size viewing**: Click any image to view in full-size modal
4. **Download**: Click file links to download/view in new tab

## 📁 File Storage Structure
```
Firebase Storage: workplace-scheduler-ace38.firebasestorage.app
└── announcements/
    └── {workplaceId}/
        └── {timestamp}_{filename}
```

## 🔧 Technical Details
- **Upload Method**: `uploadBytesResumable()` with progress tracking
- **Storage Path**: `announcements/{workplaceId}/{timestamp}_{sanitizedFileName}`
- **Access Control**: Download URLs are public but organized by workplace
- **Cleanup**: Automatic deletion when announcements are removed
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for upload failures

## 🚀 Benefits
1. **Universal Access**: All users can see files without login issues
2. **Professional Appearance**: Images display beautifully in announcements
3. **Storage Efficiency**: Uses Firebase's CDN for fast loading
4. **Mobile Friendly**: Works on all devices and screen sizes
5. **Admin Control**: Only admins can upload, but everyone can view

## 📝 Notes
- Files are uploaded to Firebase Storage (not embedded as Data URLs)
- Download URLs are generated for universal access
- Images automatically display inline for visual impact
- File size limit is 10MB per file for optimal performance
- Upload progress is shown in real-time with percentage completion

This implementation ensures that your workplace announcements can include rich media content that all users can access and enjoy!
