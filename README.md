# Fredonia Workplace Scheduler Dashboard

An updated web app for managing workplaces, creating fair schedules, handling workers, and specific admin tasks at SUNY Fredonia.  
This was built for staff, admins, and student workers to centralize shift scheduling, availability, and communication all into one place. Before this, Everything was very chaotic (the way it was set up) in my opinion, only because things can be done so much easier nowadays!
